This project involves processing the population data in the following ways to find the percentage of the population in the quered rectangle:
 Markup : * Simple and Sequential O(N)
          * Simple and Parallel. Work O(N) Span O(logN)
          * Smarter and Sequential. Work O(X*Y). Query O(1)
          * Smarter and Parallel. Query O(1)
          * Smarter and Lock-Based. Query O(1)
